# Hello, world!

I'm Victor, First of His Name (on Github). I'm an iOS developer from Barcelona, though I'm interested in other stuff, considering my interest in programming began with my first computer, a Mattel Aquarius (circa 1983 or 84). Here's a few of the side projects I've worked on, in different states of abandon.

I'm currently working at [LeadTech](https://leadtech.com) as a Staff Developer, on a wide array of pretty interesting apps, mostly utilities.
