# Hello, world!

I'm Victor, First of His Name (on Github). I'm an iOS developer from Barcelona, though I'm interested in other stuff, considering my interest in programming began with my first computer, a Mattel Aquarius (circa 1983 or 84). Here's a few of the side projects I've worked on, in different states of abandon.

I used to code for [XING](https://github.com/xing), mainly on a Github Enterprise instance, so very few of my commits were reflected on this profile for some time. ü§∑üèΩ

Nowadays, I code for [Proton](https://proton.me), and my work will be open source.
