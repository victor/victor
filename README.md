# Hello, world!

I'm Victor the first (that's how I got the username). I'm an iOS developer from Barcelona, though I'm interested in other stuff, considering my interest in programming began with my first computer, a Mattel Aquarius (circa 1983 or 84). Here's a few of the side projects I've worked on, in different states of abandon.

I'm currently writing code for [XING](https://github.com/xing), mainly on a Github Enterprise instance, so very few of my commits are reflected on this profile 🤷🏽
